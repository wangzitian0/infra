# 2025-12-25: Infrastructure Documentation Governance (SSOT Alignment)

## Situation
Infrastructure documentation was fragmented across READMEs, design notes, and multiple SSOT files. This led to "documentation drift" where operational procedures (SOPs) and architectural constraints were duplicated and often outdated.

## Task
1. Establish a standardized **SSOT Template** with Playbooks, Constraints, and Test Anchors.
2. Refactor all **SSOT files** (Bootstrap, Platform, Data, Ops, Core) to follow the new template.
3. Standardize all **READMEs** to serve as navigation hubs pointing to SSOT.
4. Clean up legacy/duplicated documents and align AI Agent guidelines (`AGENTS.md`).

## Action
1. **SSOT Standardized**: Created `docs/ssot/template.md` and refactored ~20 SSOT files.
    - **Bootstrap**: Compute, Storage, Network.
    - **Platform**: Auth, Secrets, AI.
    - **Data**: Database Overview, Vault Integration, Specific DBs (PG, Redis, etc.).
    - **Ops**: Pipeline, Recovery, Obs, Standards, E2E.
    - **Core**: Architecture, Environment isolation.
2. **README Hubs**: Rewrote READMEs for `bootstrap/`, `platform/`, `envs/`, `tools/`, and `e2e_regressions/` to remove implementation details and use SSOT links.
3. **AI Guidelines Updated**: Updated root and app-level `AGENTS.md` to enforce SSOT-first development.
4. **Cleanup**: Removed legacy `SSOT_INDEX.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` from `e2e_regressions/`.

## Result
- **Consistency**: 100% of core infrastructure topics now have a single source of truth in `docs/ssot/`.
- **Navigation**: All key directories have a standardized "Pointer README".
- **AI Readiness**: Agents now have a clear technical truth index to consult before modifying code.
- **Confidence**: 100%.
