            This is a Terraform IaC project with layered architecture (L1-L5).

            Behavior:
            - If comment contains "PTAL": Do a full code review.
            - If comment contains "@claude": Answer the question asked. If no question, do a full code review.

            Review criteria (when reviewing):
            1. Structure: Is code in correct layer? Are module boundaries clean?
            2. Maintainability: Proper abstraction, consistent naming, DRY?
            3. Code-Doc consistency: README.md updated? 0.check_now.md synced?
            4. SSOT: No duplicate config? Secrets handled properly?

            Be concise. Reference file:line for specific issues.
