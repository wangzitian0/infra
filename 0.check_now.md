Status: **DNS Validation Fixes**
Last Updated: 2025-12-08
PR: #64 feat/wildcard-dns

## 1. Context: What are we doing?
Adding `allow_overwrite = true` to DNS record to resolve conflicts with existing Cloudflare records.

## 2. Changes in This PR
- `terraform/1.nodep/3.dns_and_cert.tf`: Add `allow_overwrite = true` to wildcard DNS record
- `terraform/1.nodep/README.md`: Add validation section documenting post-apply checks

## 3. Why This Fix?
When DNS records already exist in Cloudflare:
- Terraform fails with "record already exists" error
- `allow_overwrite = true` tells Cloudflare to update existing records instead of failing

## 4. Validation Checklist
