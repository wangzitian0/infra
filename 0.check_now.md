# 0.check_now — Current Sprint Context

**Status**: Active
**Focus**: CI Standardization & Workflow Refinement

## 1. Context: What are we doing?
We are refactoring the infrastructure to be cleaner, more standard, and "Dry".

### Recent accomplishments:
1.  **SSOT Refactor**: Promoted `terraform/0.common` to `terraform/` root. Restructured layers (1.nodep, 2.env, etc.).
2.  **CI Standardization**: Solved "Two YAMLs Problem" by creating `.github/actions/terraform-setup/` (Composite Action). Plan and Apply now share identical setup logic.

## 2. Current Task: Workflow Refinement
User requested a better mechanism for tracking "Current Context".
- **Old Way**: Symlink to specific changelog.
- **New Way**: This file (`0.check_now.md`) is the **Living Context**. It accumulates context, decisions, and attempts.
- **Lifecycle**: When this "Sprint" or "Topic" is done, this file is moved to `docs/change_log/YYYY-MM-DD.topic.md` and a new `0.check_now.md` is created.

## 3. Next Steps
- [ ] Verify CI stability after standardization. (Done - PR #34 Merged)
- [ ] Refactor `0.check_now.md` mechanism (This task).
- [ ] Continue with `3.computing` (Kubero) implementation.

## 4. Notes / Attempts
- *Attempt 1*: Tried to fix CI via just editing YAMLs. Failed because `fmt` and `ssh` setup drifted.
- *Attempt 2*: Implemented Composite Action. Success. (See PR #34).
